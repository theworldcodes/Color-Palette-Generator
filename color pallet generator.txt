Color pallet generator

- I have 5 box for color
- I have a function that make hex random color code.
- I have a function that takes the hex code and converts to rgb color
- my color shown in the box's are not standard color but true random. I need to create standard colors.
- making standard color needs the use of HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)
- hue can be of (0 - 360) or in some software it also (0 - 100%), saturation can be of (0 - 100%), lightness is also same (0 - 100%);
- hue has the color choice form red green or blue on the wheel.
- saturation is 0% being the shade of gray to 100% being the most vivid color;
- lightness is 0% black to 100% white; 50% being the normal brightness.

so the idea of the discord sw dev was to put the saturation and lightness as fixed and then let the user add the hue so that the colors on the box's are going to be total in harmony and not going to be random.

but i have also those hex and rgb color in there should i maybe rather make them reverse like take the hsl code into rgb and then into hex to show 3 kind of code the user can change the hue, saturation and lightness if they want as well but it can be random as well right why not have random as well.

so basically it's choosing which you want rather than the only few things you have.

why not let the user choose which color they want random or standard or with fixed lightness or saturation which we can put. and based on that we make the color be chosen.

i will go with a ui design or the logic first then.

logic will be you will have that choice in the up to choose which kind of color you want to be generated.

random color or harmony color
